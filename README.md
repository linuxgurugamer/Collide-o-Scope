# Collide-o-Scope

Collide-o-Scope has one job: Assist with the creation of Kraken devices.

## Installation

1. !!!IMPORTANT!!! If going from KSP 1.2.2 to 1.3, delete the old Collide-o-Scope folder.

2. !!!IMPORTANT!!! Remove KSP/GameData/Collide-o-Scope folder.

3. Copy the 'Squidsoft Collective' folder into your KSP/GameData folder. (MAC USERS: If this folder already exists, move one level deeper and copy Collide-o-Scope into 'Squidsoft Collective' to prevent overwriting other mods)

## Usage

Collide-o-Scope is an advanced tweakable. As such your game will need Advanced Tweakables enabled. There are several places to check this:

1. From the main menu go to Settings->General. Note: This will not change the option for games in progress.
2. From the space center or flight scenes press Escape and choose Settings. It will be under the Gameplay section.

After Advanced Tweakables is enabled a new application button will appear when in the SPH/VAB or when controlling a craft. When this button is lit up (green) the tweakable is visible when right-clicking on parts to bring up the action menu. Simply select the tweakable to change its mode.

NOTE: You may turn on as many colliders as you wish, however this will cause performance problems if too many are active at once.

An alternative to the action menu is to place your mouse cursor over a part and press the assigned hotkey. The default hotkey is 'O' (capital oh) and may be changed in the PluginData/settings.cfg file.

To turn off all colliders at once move your mouse cursor so that no part is under it and press the hotkey. You may also press the application button to disable the tweakables.

## Notes

- There are bugs in this mod. I am not a graphics programmer. The rendering code was written by someone else. The bugs that exist also exist in the mod where the code first appeared. These bugs are not major and the mod works as intended.

- Any craft and save game written with the application active (green) will have minor amounts of information written to them. This is a KSP thing that cannot be worked around. There is no effect other than warnings in the log when these files are reloaded. Don't panic, I just want everyone to know this happens and that I looked into having it not occur.
